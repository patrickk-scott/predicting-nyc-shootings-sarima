# Conclusions
After a comprehensive exploration of the NYPD Shooting Incident Data, the SARIMA model effectively captured the data's temporal intricacies. While it showcased a promising fit, there remains a hint of residual seasonality, suggesting potential avenues for further refinement. This analysis underscores the value of data-driven approaches in anticipating and potentially mitigating public safety concerns in New York City.
